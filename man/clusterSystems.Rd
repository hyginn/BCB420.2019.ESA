\usage{
clusterSystems(systems, distances = NULL, customDistanceFn = NULL,
  dataSources = NULL, combineMatrices, plotVennDiagrams = TRUE, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{systems}{List of input systems that should be
re-clustered. Each element is formatted according to the output of
\code{SyDBgetSysSymbols} (a named list of HGNC symbols).}

\item{distances}{Character vector indicating choice of data to be used
to measure distance between input genes. Vector containing one or more of
 \code{c("expression_profile", "transcription_factor", "network_jaccard",
 "network_distance")} or NULL if no built in distance metric is to be used
 (in this case a custom distance metric must be used instead.) Default is NULL.}

\item{customDistanceFn}{Optional list of functions. Any custom functions
that are to be used to calculate pairwise distances between genes. Default
is NULL. If this parameter is not NULL, then \code{dataSources} parameter
must also be provided and be a list of the same length.}

\item{dataSources}{Optional list of input data appropriate to be used in
conjunction with \code{customDistanceFn}. Elements may have any type
that is required as input by the custom distance function, but must be
contained within a list. The entries should
be in the same order as \code{customDistanceFn} such that the ith element
of \code{customDistanceFn} uses the data provided in the ith element of
\code{dataSources} as input. Default is NULL.}

\item{combineMatrices}{Length 1 character vector indicating the method by which
to combine distance matrices if more than one choice of distance data is provided.
If only one type of distance data is provided, then this parameter is
ignored. One of \code{c('sum', 'product', 'minimum', 'maximum')}.}

\item{plotVennDiagrams}{Logical flag; indicated whether or not Venn
diagrams representing the set overlap of the output should be printed when
the function is called. Default is TRUE.}

\item{k}{Optional integer. The number of clusters. Default is \code{length(systems)}
if no value provided.}
}
\value{
A named list of length 4. Elements of the list include:

\code{$Clusters} A named vector of integers from 1 to k. Names of the
elements represent the genes belonging to that cluster.

\code{$Best_matches} A named vector of length k representing the cluster
with the best set overlap for each input system.

\code{$Jaccard_indexes} The Jaccard indexes measuring the similarity
between each system and the cluster which is its best match.

\code{$P_values} P values representing the probability of having a
Jaccard index greater than those observed by choosing a random cluster
of the same size from the set of input genes.
}
\description{
\code{ClusterSystems} inputs a list of biological systems and re-clusters
the genes on an input variable of interest. Set overlap
between the output clusters and clusters defined by input system
membership is measured.
}
\details{
The input systems are clustered according to the specified variables(s)
of interest using PAM (partition around medoids) clustering. The
similarity between input and output sets is measured using the Jaccard
index of set overlap. P values for the observed Jaccard Indexes are
calculated by measuring the Jaccard index of 1000 clusters randomly
sampled from the input genes.
}
\section{Distance metrics }{

There are several different built in methods to compute the distance
between a pair of genes.

\code{"expression_profile"} uses GEO data to compute the similarity
between 2 genes as the absolute value of the Spearmann correlation
between their expression profiles. Distance is then taken as 1 - similarity.

\code{"transcription_factor"} GTRD data to compute the number of
shared transcription that bind upstream of the 2 genes divided by the
total number of transcription factors.
In effect, the Jaccard index of the sets of transcription factors from the
2 genes. Distance is then calculated as 1 - similarity.

\code{"network_jaccard"} uses STRING network data to calculate the Jaccard
similarity between the immediate neighbours of the 2 genes. Distance is
then calculated as 1 - similarity.

\code{"network_distance"} uses STRING network data and calculates the
shortest path between the 2 genes.
}

\section{More than one distance metric}{
 If more than one distance data
type is provided, the various distance metrics will be combined into one
distance matrix according to one of the following methods:

\code{'sum'} indicates the distances between a pair of genes will be
defined as the sum of the distances according to each metric.

\code{'product'} indicates that the distance between genes is defined as
the product of their pairwise distances. This method more strongly
penalizes genes that are distant by more than one metric.

\code{'maximum'} or \code{'minimum'} indicate that the distance between
2 genes should be the maximum or minimum of the distances measured by each
metric respectively.
}

\section{Custom distance metrics}{
 In addition to several distance metrics
which are built in to the function, the user has the option of defining a
new distance metric to measure pairwise similarity between genes. If this
is the case, an appropriate source of data (mapping from HGNC symbols to
data of interest) that can be used as in input for each custom distance
function.

myDB <- fetchData("SysDB")

# Cluster all of the systems in the database according to
# the sum of transcription factor distance and Jaccard network distance:

               distances = c("transcription_factor", "network_jaccard"),
               combineMatrices = 'sum')

# Cluster all of the systems using expression profile distance
# but format it like a custom distance function
GEO <- fetchData("GEOprofiles")
clusterSystems(systems,
               distances = NULL,
               customDistanceFn = list(expr_dist),
               dataSources = list(GEO))
