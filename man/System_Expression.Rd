\title{System level expression values.}
\usage{
System_Expression(sysname, myQNXP)
}
\arguments{
\item{sysname}{(character) 5-letter code of system being investigated}

\item{myQNXP}{(matrix) Matrix of expressions. Columns represent experiments and
rows individual genes}
}
\value{
(list) A list containing 3 elements. The first the mean log normalized
gene expression by condition. Second and third the conditions where the system
is significantly up and down regulated respectively.
}
\description{
\code{exProf} Returns the log-normalized expression values for gene provided.
}
\details{
\code{System_Expression} Provides the mean expression level for each experiment
present in the dataset. As well, displays which conditions are up and down
regulted significantly.
