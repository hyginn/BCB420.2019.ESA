\title{Transcription Factor Distance}
\usage{
tf_dist(gene1, gene2, geneList)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene1}{String, HGNC symbol for the first gene.}

\item{gene2}{String, HGNC symbol for the second gene.}

\item{geneList}{A list of lists of transcription factors than have binding
sites upstream of genes. Generated by calling \code{\link{fetchData}("GTRDgeneTFs")}.}
}
\value{
The similarity score of gene1 and gene2: number of shared upstream
transcription factors.
}
\description{
\code{tf_dist} Calculate upstream transcription factor binding site distance between 2
genes.
}
\details{
Calculate the distance/dissimilarity of upstream transcription factors of 2 genes.
Similarity is taken to be the Jaccard Index of the set overlap between the 2
transcription factors sets. Distance is then taken to be 1 - similarity.
}
\examples{
# Calculate the transcription factor distance of 2 related genes "BRCA1" and "BRCA2"
geneList <- fetchData("GTRDgeneTFs")
tf_dist("BRCA1", "BRCA2", geneList)
