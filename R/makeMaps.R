#' Generate the genetic interpretation map of BioGrid GGI tags of system's
#'  physical interactions.

#' @return (dataframe) An 11-by-3 dataframe mapping BioGrid GGI tag to its
#'  interpretation assuming that the system's components also interact
#'  physically. The first column contains the official BioGRID GGI tags; the
#'  second contains interpreted relationships under the assumption; the third
#'   contains notes on interpretation.
