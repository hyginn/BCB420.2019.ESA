# knitr knits in a new session with an empty global workspace after setting its
# working directory to ./vignettes. To make your package functions available in
# the vignette, you have to load the library. The following two lines should
# accomplish this without manual intervention:
pkgName <- trimws(gsub("^Package:", "", readLines("../DESCRIPTION")[1]))
library(pkgName, character.only = TRUE)

# About this Vignette

This function is capable of taking a defined system name and providing its specific expression profiles. This includes normalizing the epression levels provided by the function and then providing a mean expression for each experiment. It will additionally identify which conditions caused the system to be significantly up or down regulated.

# Example and usage
If we want to see the responses of the PHALY to the various conditions present in the dataset, we will perform the following function

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the expression profiles:
myURL <- paste0("http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/assets/",
                "GEO-QN-profile-2019-03-24.rds")
myQNXP <- readRDS(url(myURL))  # loads quantile-normalized expression data

#Call created function
System_Expression("PHALY", myQNXP)
```
# Session Info

This release of the `BCB420.2019.ESA` package was produced in the following context of supporting packages:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sessionInfo()
```
