# About this Vignette

This Vignette explains the input and output of the ESA tool 

## Input 

This tool takes the input of a curated systems code name, defined during the system curation unit and HGNC data. 

## Underlying process defined in the function 

Taking the system code, it retrieves gene sets annotated to the system and runs GOenrichment() analysis from the GOSim package from bioconductor, retrieving the GO terms enriched to the gene set under investigation. 

It then runs a semantic similarity analysis using mclusterSim() from the GOSemSim package in bioconductor.

##Output 

The final output is a semanitic similarity matrix of the enriched GO terms for the system under investigation
